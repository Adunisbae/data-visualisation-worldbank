Introduction:
Data Visualisation is a general term that describes the process of interpreting large and small datasets and presenting them in a visual format, that is easier for the human brain to understand and process (Islam, 2019). It is also the graphical representation of data and information through charts, graphs and maps. This report explores the significance of data visualisation, its applications in research, and an evaluation of existing visualizations with recommendations for improvement. Additionally, it discusses the use of 2D and 3D visualisation, including Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), and provides a practical analysis of a dataset using Tableau.

Background Information on Data Visualisation:
In the late 18th century, pioneers like William Playfair transformed data representation by creating the first bar and line charts, which remain fundamental tools in data visualisation today (Friendly, et. al., 2008). Playfair aimed to make complex economic data approachable by providing the framework for modern visualisation techniques. Another important person in the history of data visualisation was Charles Minard, who is renowned for his 1869 map of Napoleon’s Russian campaign, which communicated complex information, such as geography, time and troop movement in a visual representation (Tufte, 2006). Minard’s map is now recognised as a masterpiece of data visualisation because it effectively blends various data dimensions into a single, coherent narrative, see Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1: Charles Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign (Minard, 1869).
In Figure 1 above, the sharp contrast between the advancing and retreating army lines tells a captivating story. However, the French labels, brief legend and unclear connection between the temperature graph and the main map may be challenging for modern viewers. Suggested improvements for a modernised edition include multilingual labelling, enhanced contrast, vertical alignment lines connecting temperature and geography, and an interactive structure allowing users to explore campaign spots.
The emergence of big data and technological advancements in this modern era have made data visualisation an essential tool for communication and analysis. Open-source libraries, like D3.js and Matplotlib, along with existing software tools like Tableau, and PowerBI, have enabled users to produce dynamic, interactive visualisations that can process and present massive datasets in an understandable manner (Peiris, 2024). These technologies have established access to advanced visualisation capabilities, allowing people with different levels of expertise to analyse and share data insights. As data volume and complexity continue to increase, the importance of data visualisation has increased. According to (Panghal, 2024), good visualisation not only makes analysis easier, but also improves decision-making by making patterns, trends and outliers easier to spot.
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into data visualisation tools has significantly advanced the field. AI-driven technologies automate data processing, improve predictive capabilities and improve user experience by developing customised and user-friendly visualisation techniques (Jiang et. al., 2024). For example, AI can automatically discover trends in data and recommend relevant visualisation techniques, providing an easier alternative for users to gain insights.

Purpose of Data Visualisation in Research:
Data Visualisation is an essential research tool that transforms complicated datasets into visual representations that are easy to understand. By displaying patterns, trends and outliers, data visualisation enhances understanding and makes it easier to communicate research findings to a range of audiences (Unwin, 2020).
One of the primary goals of Data Visualisation in Research is to improve data analysis. Researchers can rapidly find important insights, like correlations and anomalies, that might otherwise be unnoticed by converting data into visual representations (Ouyang, 2024). For example, in climate research, visualisations of temperature changes across time might indicate global warming patterns that are not immediately visible in tabular data.
Data Visualisation also plays a vital role in decision-making. Visualisations allow researchers and policymakers to make informed decision based on real-world evidence, since they display data in a clear and straightforward manner (R, 2023). For example, in healthcare, visualisations of patient data might aid in identifying trends in disease outbreaks, allowing for prompt treatments.
Despite its advantages, Data Visualisation encounters many challenges. Biases in visual representation can lead to misinterpretation of data, while accessibility difficulties can prevent certain audiences from properly engaging with visual content. Furthermore, the ethical consequences of fabricating data such as using misleading scales or selectively selecting data points must be carefully evaluated (Wang et. al., 2015). The continuous developments in data visualisation techniques continue to have important implications for research across various disciplines, as (drsafaseefo, 2024), demonstrates through several examples and datasets, highlighting the evolving landscape and the significance of keeping up with current trends and technologies. 

Examples of Data Visualisation:
In 2025, Data Visualisation still plays an essential role for making difficult information accessible and engaging. (Glivinska, 2024) has gathered the best visualisations of 2025, and here are some of the examples in cutting-edge research. One of the examples of Data Visualisation in the latest cutting-edge research is NASA’s “Eyes on Asteroids”, an interactive visualisation that allows users to travel the asteroid belt and observe the current locations of asteroids in out solar system. This tool provides a 3D model of the solar system, which enables users to zoom in and out to explore asteroids and other celestial entities. Both researchers and the public can benefit from the real-time data stream, which ensures that users have up-to-date information on the locations and paths of asteroids, which can be seen in Figure 2 below.
 
Figure 2: NASA's Eyes on Asteroids (Glivinska, 2024). The interactive version can be accessed by clicking on the image.
In Figure 2 above, its immersive design, which includes clearly labelled major asteroids and illuminating celestial objects, is one of its strongest points. However, the absence of a legend encourages users to click on objects for context, and the unclear information structure makes it difficult to distinguish asteroids from minor ones. A multi-level zoom function to enable in-depth investigation, a descriptive legend for clarity, improved time markers on the slider and a hierarchical structure for object importance are possible improvements.
Another example of the latest cutting-edge research is the “IV State of Audio and Voice study, which uses data visualisation techniques to emphasise important findings. It provides insights into the most recent trends in the audio sector. Visualisations in this research highlight the development of voice and audio technology, the effects of generative AI on the sector and the significance of human interaction in voice applications, as can be seen in Figure 3 below.
 
Figure 3: IV State of Audio and Voice (Glivinska, 2024). The interactive version can be accessed by clicking on the image.
In Figure 3 above, its interactive design, which removes overlapping data points and guarantees clarity with a dark background that improves contrast, is its biggest feature. The clear labelling successfully draws attention to regional tendencies, displaying that the interest of audiobooks in Navarra and La Rioja is lower compared to Catalonia and Madrid. However, additional features like a timeline to monitor trends in audio over time, tooltips that provide demographic information, and a comparison mode to compare two formats simultaneously could improve its analytical depth.
Additionally, the “Water Consumption” visualisation is another example of cutting-edge research, which offers a thorough summary of global water consumption by industry. This visualisation, which can be seen in Figure 4 below, brings awareness to the major users of water, such as domestic, industrial and agricultural consumption and highlights the necessity of sustainable water management techniques. This visualisation facilitates effective communication of crucial information and encourage well-informed decision-making by displaying data in an understandable and visually appealing manner.
 
Figure 4: Water Consumption (Glivinska, 2024). More information can be found by clicking on the image.
In Figure 4 above, this visualisation illustrates worldwide water usage using maps, iconography and statistics, however the colour-coded globe map lacks a clear legend, leaving viewers unsure of what it represents. Small amounts of explanatory language make things less accessible, and the relationships between pieces are unclear. A more comprehensive and engaging perspective on global water consumption could be achieved by integrating a legend, enhancing typography, strengthening visual connections between related data points and adding industry-specific water usage are possible suggestions for improvement.
Another example of cutting-edge research is the “Visualising the History of Pandemics”, which provides a visual timeline of each known pandemic along with details on the number s people impacted, the transmission of the disease and its causes. This infographic offers a detailed summary of the historical background of pandemics and is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, which can be seen in Figure 5 below.
 
Figure 5: Visualising the History of Pandemics (Glivinska, 2024). More information can be found by clicking on the image.
In Figure 5 above, its viewpoint makes date comparisons challenging and the spiky ball sizes prevent accurate death toll comparisons, the triangle timeline provides historical complexity. Additionally, the random colour scheme loses on a chance to convey more data. The clarity and storytelling would be improved with a more conventional linear chronology, accurate death toll reference lines, systematic colour coding (e.g. by disease kind), and a closer connection between the comparison and the main visualisation would be possible improvements.
Examples of 2D and 3D (Augmented and Virtual Reality):

{2D Data Visualisation}:
One of the most popular and easily accessible ways to present information is presently 2D Data Visualisation. Tools such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots are often used due to their simplicity and effectiveness in conveying trends and comparisons (Nguyen, 2021). However, 2D visualisations are limited based on their incapacity to accurately depict spatially complicated or multi-dimensional data, which often requires more advanced methods (Tailoor, 2024). An example of a 2D visualisation can be seen in Figure 6 below.
 
Figure 6: The World’s Population at 8 billion (Glivinska, 2024).
In Figure 6 above, this visualisation effectively illustrates how Asian nations dominate the world’s population using regional breakdowns and a proportionate circular treemap. Even though the colour-coded technique aids with differentiation, the colour scheme does not naturally reflect population density, and the small parts for less populous countries make it difficult to analyse. A revised colour gradient that represents population density, enhanced font for easier reading, interactive features that provide specific data when hovered over, and other components like population growth predictions for more contextual understanding are all possible improvements.

{3D Data Visualisation}:
3D visualisations give data a third dimension, which makes it possible to display intricate spatial linkages and structures (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). In disciplines, where comprehension of depth and perspective is essential, such as astronomy, geology and medicine, this is especially beneficial (Venkatesan, 2021). One key advantage of 3D visualisation is its interactivity, as it enables users to work with models by rotating, zooming and exploring various viewpoints, which improves understanding and engagement. However, one key disadvantage of 3D visualisations, is that they are more complicated to create and understand, often requiring specialised knowledge and tools, thereby making it harder for some users to use (Tailoor, 2024).
 
Figure 7: 3D Surface Plots (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).
In Figure 7 above, a mathematical function between two variables (X and Y) is displayed as a 3D surface plot visualisation. The output value (Z) is represented by a purple-green-yellow gradient with height. The generic axis labels and lack of a title restrict the clarity of the colour gradient and context, even though it improves contours and depth perception. A descriptive title, contour lines, a clear colour legend and meaningful axis descriptors, (e.g. Temperature (°C) and Pressure (kPa)) should be included to enhance reading. Rotation and zooming capabilities are examples of interactive features that would improve usability.
 
{AR and VR Data Visualisation}:
Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) visualisations improve data representation by going beyond conventional 2D and 3D methods. AR creates interactive experiences by incorporating digital information onto actual landscapes, while VR on the other hand, immerses users entirely in digital spaces for in-depth data investigation (Billinghurst et. al., 2015). These techniques are especially useful for jobs like urban planning and surgical planning that need extensive training and simulation. According to (Duenser et. al., 2008), one of the main benefits of AR and VR is their capacity to enhance cognitive processing through pattern identification and decision-making through spatial immersion. The requirement for specific technology, including head-mounted displays and careful design considerations to prevent cognitive overload (Venkatesan, 2021; McMahan et. al., 2012). Even though, AR and VR are more interactive than traditional 2D techniques, continuous technological developments are required to increase accessibility and usability. In Figure 8 and Figure 9, below are examples of AR and VR visualisations respectively.
 
Figure 8: Place IKEA furniture in your home with augmented reality (Poetker, 2019). The full video can be accessed by clicking on the image.
In Figure 8 above, the IKEA Augmented Reality Visualisation uses a simple and user-friendly interface to show clients how to realistically arrange furniture in their homes using a mobile device. However, its functionality is limited by the absence of scale indicators and interactivity elements. The accuracy and usability would be enhanced by the addition of visual scaling cues, dimension lines, and customisation options, (such as altering colours or materials).
 
Figure 9: 21 years of the Nasdaq – Wall Street Journal (Ezera, 2016). The interactive version can be accessed by clicking on the image.
In Figure 9 above, this visualisation presents a virtual walkthrough of 21 years of Nasdaq performance. It illustrates market volatility using a symmetrical mountain shape, where peaks and troughs stand for financial highs and lows. The clarity of the visualisation is enhanced by the basic colour scheme and black background, which maintain the data/s emphasis. It is difficult for users to comprehend the causes of market volatility, however because the visualisation does not include contextual annotations for significant economic events. The inclusion of interactive components, like tooltips or comments emphasising significant market occurrences, will enhance usability by offering insightful context. The clarity can be improved, while maintaining the immersive experience by including navigation hints and a dynamic legend that shows values in real time as users navigate the visualisation.

Conclusion:
Data Visualisation is essential for transforming complicated datasets into understandable insights that support research and decision-making. This report highlights multiple examples of Data Visualisation, including 2D, 3D, AR and VR, demonstrating their advantages, disadvantages, as well as providing suggestions for possible improvements. The tableau-based findings indicate fundamental socioeconomic patterns, such as gender differences in labour involvement, with men generally having greater participation rates, and the economic impact of migration, where remittances play an important role in maintaining some countries. Additionally, the examination of education attainment and skill constraints reveals a strong relationship between average schooling levels and labour availability, while insights into youth unemployment highlight the critical need for measures that bridge the education-job market gap. While technology improvements like AI-driven analytics and interactive tools improve data comprehension, there are challenges in addressing biases and improving accessibility. As data visualisation advances, it remains an essential tool for enabling driven decision-making and strategic planning across multiple fields. The following section will discuss further insights derived from Tableau visualisations, providing a detailed analysis of data trends and patterns.
 
Tableau-based findings:
{Bar Charts}:
 
Figure 10: Average Participation Rate for Women vs Men ages (15-24) in 2010 by country.
In Figure 10 above, is a comparison of the average labour force participation rates between men and women aged 15-24 in different countries in 2010. According to the visualisation, significant gender differences are revealed, with men typically having higher participation rates than women. This pattern is an indication to established cultural norms and societal expectations that frequently restrict women’s access to opportunities for education and employment. For instance, the gender gap in participation rates is particularly noticeable in countries like Timor-Leste (where the average participation rate for men is 17.50% and for women is 7.70%), which highlights the urgent need for gender-equitable policies. However, countries like Mauritania (where the average participation rate for men is 81.30% and for women is 82.80%) exhibit a more balanced participation rate, which indicates that policies supporting gender equality in the workforce and in education are having a positive impact. Developed countries like those in North America and Europe typically have higher average rates of participation for both men and women, because of more inclusive labour markets and better access to education. Despite this, men continue to dominate the workforce in these countries, emphasising the need for continuous attempts to address gender inequality. In the bar chart, men and women participation rates can easily be compared, because of the use of contrasting colours for men (blue) and women (pink), which improves the data clarity. The constant colour scheme makes the identification of patterns, like the superiority of male participation rates in general and the outliers like Lao PDR (where the average participation rate of women is higher than the value of men).

 
Figure 11: Top 10 Countries with the Highest Unemployment Rate against Working Age Population in 2010.
In Figure 11 above, is a comparison of the top 10 countries with the highest unemployment rates in 2010 and their working-age populations. The visualisation reflects broader concerns like economic transition, insufficient job creation, as well as lack of industrial diversification and indicates major economic challenges in countries like Bulgaria, which has the highest unemployment rate (with a score of 10.20%). The difference between the unemployment rate (red bars) and working-age population (teal bars) indicates a strain in the economies where labour supply exceeds demand. For instance, high unemployment rates compared to the working-age population of countries like Argentina and Belgium suggest an imbalance between the size of the workforce and the availability of jobs. If this imbalance is not addressed by targeted policy interventions, it may result in social instability and economic stagnation. With several European nations ranking prominently in the top 10, the visualisation also reveals, regional trends, illustrating that even developed countries struggle to maintain low unemployment rates. The proportionate sizing of the bars also indicates the relationship between the unemployment rates and the size of the working-age population in the countries.

 
Figure 12: Yearly Average Value Added Per Worker.
In Figure 12 above, the visualisation displays the average value added per worker (in 2005 USD) for selected countries across three years: 1995, 2005, and 2010. Countries like Japan, Sweden and the U.S typically exhibit high levels of productivity, because of their advanced economies, highly developed educational systems and robust technological infrastructure. These countries set the standard for productivity and demonstrate the benefits on sustained investments in workforce development and innovation. However, throughout the course of the 15-year period, developing countries like Czech Republic and the Republic of Korea have seen significant improvements in productivity, which is an indication of effective economic reforms and industrialisation. This rising pattern indicates that the developing countries are catching up to the developed countries, in terms of productivity, because of more investments in education, technology and infrastructure. The visualisation highlights the importance of these investments in promoting economic expansion and the global trend of increase in productivity over time.

Figure 13: Average Migration and Economic Impact for Top 30 countries.
In Figure 13 above, the visualisation displays the migration trends and their economic impacts using the average values of emigrants (% of native population), immigrants (% of population), labour share (% of national income) and remittances (% of GDP). Using a colour gradient that ranges from light to dark tones, it is easy to identify countries with substantial economic consequences and migration flows. With high immigrant percentages, countries like Armenia and Belize stand out for having an unusual high number of migrants in comparison to their populations. However, countries like Burkina Faso and Guinea which have low migrant rates display uneven economic circumstances. The visualisation emphasises the importance of remittances, especially in countries with significant immigrant populations, where they make up a large portion of the GDP like Armenia. The relationship between migration and economic success is highlighted by this visualisation, as it illustrates the necessity of policies that integrate immigrants into the labour market and use remittances to encourage economic growth.

{Map Visualisation}:
 
Figure 14: Compares the Average School Years (2010), Skills Constraints (2010) and predicted Educational Attainment for (2010) using (2009) data.
In Figure 14 above, this visualisation displays an overview of global education levels and skill constraints using colour gradients and bar sizes. Darker regions (like North America, Europe and East Asia) indicate higher average schooling years, while lighter regions (like Africa and South Asia) indicate lower average schooling years. The associated bars for skill constraints demonstrate the significant relationship between education investment and labour availability by indicating that areas with higher levels of education typically have less skill constraints. However, skill shortages exist in some moderately educated areas like Mongolia (that has an average schooling of 8.40 years and skills as a constraint of 15%), which indicates an imbalance between educational institutions and labour market demands. The use of the colour gradient makes it easy to identify the areas with high and low levels of education, and the bar widths give a visual representation of skill constraints. This visualisation emphasises that to close the skills gap globally, educational systems must be integrated with business demands and vocational training must be improved.

{Line Chart}:
 
Figure 15: Trends in Labour Force Participation by Gender and Age Group between 1995 and 2010.
In Figure 15 above, this visualisation displays the rates of labour force participation by gender (men / women) and age group (15-24 / 25-64) over a 15-year period (1995 – 2010). Gender gaps in the labour force remain, as seen by the higher participation rates of men compared to women. Although, the pink line, which represents women between the ages of 25-64, shows an upward pattern, signifying advancements in female workforce participation, because of better educational opportunities and shifting social standards. Participation rates are lower among younger age groups (15-24), because a majority of this group are still enrolled in school. Policies that promote female labour participation and link educational systems with labour market demands are necessary, as seen by using different colours for each gender and age group, which allows trend comparison over time. 
{Scatter Plot}:
 
Figure 16: Total Youth Unemployment (%) vs Total Value Added per Worker.
In Figure 16 above, this visualisation displays an analysis of the relationship between youth unemployment and productivity by gender. Youth unemployment rates are typically higher in countries with low productivity rates, indicating that young people are particularly affected by a skills-job imbalance. The visualisation also shows that young women often have greater unemployment rates than young men, because of discrimination in the workplace, cultural obstacles or restricted educational opportunities. The use of distinct colours for each gender makes comparisons simple and emphasises the need for specific policies to address these differences. By increasing productivity through education, infrastructure and technology investments, countries can reduce unemployment rates and increase work opportunities for youths. 



{Bubble Chart}:
 
Figure 17: Comparison of Total Youths Not in School or at Work (%) by Gender and Year in Top 15 countries.
In Figure 17 above, the visualisation displays exclusion from school and work in 15 countries between 1995 and 2010, categorised by gender. The bigger dark pink and purple bubbles show that women experience higher exclusion than men, especially in India, Indonesia and Pakistan, where women’s access to work and education is restricted by cultural and economic constraints. Some countries like Bulgaria and Kazakhstan show minor advancements over time, but others remain stationary like India, suggesting persistent structural problems. South and Southeast Asian countries dominance in the graph, emphasises the necessity of focused measures to close the gaps in employment and education. The use of distinct colours and proportionate bubble sizes, improves the understanding of these differences and makes it an effective tool for identifying areas that require the most policy interventions.

{Tree Map}:
  
Figure 18: Visualization of the Top 10 Policy Scores by Category and Country, with the productivity levels being represented by the colour.
In Figure 18 above, this visualisation compares the policy scores across categories and top 10 countries, with larger blocks indicating higher scores and different colours representing productivity levels. Strong policy frameworks, especially in areas like labour market regulations and social security contributions, relate to higher productivity ratings in countries (like Argentina), highlighting the link between economic performance and effective policies. Countries with strong policy frameworks and high productivity levels, as those in Northern Europe, are easily identified by using a green-blue colour gradient and proportionate block sizes. The visualisation emphasises the importance of implementing focused policy measures in specific areas to boost economic efficiency and development.






{Box and Whiskers Plot}:
 
Figure 19: Productivity and social cohesion scores for selected European countries, with colour intensity representing productivity levels and bubble size indicating score magnitude.
In Figure 19 above, the visualisation compares productivity and social cohesion scores in different European countries, where the bubble sizes indicate the score quantity and the colour intensity represents productivity levels. Portugal and Spain have space for development, while Finland and Switzerland have good productivity rankings that represent their robust economic development. The visualisation also shows that social cohesion scores fluctuate depending on productivity, with nations like Denmark and Ireland establishing a balance between the two measurements. This emphasises the importance of inclusive policies that support social well-being and promote economic efficiency.
